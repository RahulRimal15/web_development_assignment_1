    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Rahul Rimal.I am a 20 years old BSCS second year student at King's College, Kathmandu. I currently
        live at Kapan, Kathmandu.I enjoy playing football, traveling with my family, and learning musical instruments. I
        am passionate about computer science and web development, so I created this webpage to share a bit about myself
        and showcase my learnings about HTML.
